        <h1>BRAND MODIFIER - SUCCESS!</h1>
        <h2>
            Each Intel Core processor chip has something called a brand modifier. These don't really provide any specific information other than give a rough estimate
            of when that chip was produced. For example, you wouldn't need to know too much about cars to figure that a 2019 Subaru Outback will run better than the a
            car of the same make and model manufactured in 2000. Since your chip has an <span>{{processor_specs_result_dict['Success']['Brand Modifier']['User']}} brand modifier</span> and <span class="game">{{game}}</span> has an <span>{{processor_specs_result_dict['Success']['Brand Modifier']['Game']}} brand modifier</span>,
            you can run <span class="game">{{game}}.</span>
