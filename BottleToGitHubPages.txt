First, you would need to create your website using the Bottle framework in Python.

Next, you would need to use a tool like Frozen-Flask to generate static HTML files 
from your Bottle application.

Once you have generated the static files, you would need to create a new repository on GitHub.

You would then need to push the static files to the gh-pages branch of your repository.

Finally, you would need to configure your repository settings to use GitHub pages to serve the files.
